# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview of the project

Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks were used for this challenge to complete the extract and transform phases. The backers’ contact information from a CSV file was extracted and transformed to create a DataFrame that was exported as a CSV file. Then, the dataset was used to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database.

CSV file that contains the backers’ information was uploaded into that table. Finally, data analysis was performed on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
